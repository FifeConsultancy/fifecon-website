Traditional Legacy Hosting / SaaS / PaaS / IaaS
Our specialist skills and experience provides solutions across a range of technology stacks and support your chosen service model for application hosting.

I-CODE – Junior Programming Learning Interface
Fife Consultancy is currently developing an application aimed at teaching young programmers (UK key stage 2 & 3) the basics of software engineering. Based around the Python language, the application is designed to provide a number of modular tools and resources of increasing complexity that can a help a programming to create their own programs, whilst learning how the 
code itself works and eventually how it is written. In the later stages of development we hope to be able to develop a number of contacts with local schools and higher eduction institutes, with the intention of testing and improving the application whilst providing learning resources and cooperative arrangements in return.
